### Joomla!, Magento and WordPress Front-end developer

Although this page was built using Jekyll most of the time I work with Joomla! and Magento (1.9.x and 2.x) and sometimes WordPress. The CMS I use depends on the needs of the project. A lot of functionality can be done with the core of each and every CMS.

Pellentesque convallis, felis vel egestas gravida, ligula est aliquet ante, a eleifend nulla nulla.
